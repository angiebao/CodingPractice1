# Given a list of strings dict where all the strings are of the same length.
#
# Return True if there are 2 strings that only differ by 1 character in the same index, otherwise return False.
#
# Follow up: Could you solve this problem in O(n*m) where n is the length of dict and m is the length of each string.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: dict = ["abcd","acbd", "aacd"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Strings "abcd" and "aacd" differ only by one character in the index 1.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: dict = ["ab","cd","yz"]
# Output: false

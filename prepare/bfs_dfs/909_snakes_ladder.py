# 909. Snakes and Ladders
# Medium
#
# On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:
#
#
# You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square x, consists of the following:
#
# You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.
# (This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)
# If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.
# A board square on row r and column c has a "snake or ladder" if board[r][c] != -1.  The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].
#
# Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)
#
# Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return -1.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [
# [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
# [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
# [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
# [-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
# [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
# [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].
# You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.
# You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.
# You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.
# You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
# It can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.
# Note:
#
# 2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20
# board[i][j] is between 1 and N*N or is equal to -1.
# The board square with number 1 has no snake or ladder.
# The board square with number N*N has no snake or ladder.
